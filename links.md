# LINKS
## This page contains some links that help to understand Operating Systems

## 1. INTRODUCTION OPERATING SYSTEM
  * a. [Definition](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html)
  * This website is explain what is operating system and also contain some things that you should now in operating systems including history, types, function, and features. Also this site discuss some advatage and disadvantages of using operating systems.
  * b. [Some example of the operating system](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)
  * This site contains some example of the operating systems that people use these days. Also the history and the benefits of use one of the operating systems that already popular for the users.
## 2. Sofware Licenses
  * a. [Definiton & Types](https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-a-software-license/)
  * In week 1, we discuss about the license and this site give me some good explaination about the software license and some things that I need to know how the software license work

  * This web contain lot of explaination why we need cyber security and types that can we get if cyber threats. Also the page show some cyber tips to prevent or handle the cyber threats
## 4. File Systems
  * a. [File system interface](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-file-system.html)
  * In this page, there some more explanation about the interface in the file systems and there some example of the code that can be use for the virtual file systems (vfs).
## 5. C language
  * a. [How does it works(Explaination)](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)
  * I put the page that explain the C language because I think I need to start understanding the C language faster because every quiz, there's always some topic using the C language and also Sir Rahmat ask the class alot about the C language.
  * b. [In operating systems](https://www.guru99.com/c-programming-language.html#:~:text='C'%20language%20is%20widely%20used,using%20'C'%20programming%20language.)
  * The connection about the operating systems and used C language as the programming language. Also some example how to try it and the benefits of using C language
## 6. Memory
  * a. [Memory Allocation in C languange](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)
  * The page is explain the memory allocation in C language. This site also helps me to answer the quiz because there some example of the code using C language also answering the forum question about malloc(), calloc(), free()
  * b. [Virtual Memory I](http://www.mampirlah.com/teknik-informatika/pengertian-tujuan-dan-fungsi-virtual-memory.html)
  * In this week quiz, there are lot's of question regarding the memory which are virtual memory and the physical memory. There are the definition of virtual memory and also the types and function of the virtual memory
  * c. [Virtual Memory II](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)
  * This webpage also helps me understand more about the virtual memory because it explain about virtual memory vs physical memory. It also discuss the limitations of the virtual memory besides of the benefits.
## 7. Threads
  * a. [Definition](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html)
  * In this page, I learn more to become understand about threads and also know the difference between single and multiple threads. There also some picture to help me understand the material
  * b. [Advantages & Disadvantages]( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/single-threaded-and-multi-threaded-processes#:~:text=Single%20threaded%20processes%20contain%20the,program%20at%20the%20same%20time.)
  * This page also explain the benefits of using multithreads but there are still some negative impact if we use a multiple threads
## 8. Process Comunication
  * a. [Inter Process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)
  * This webpage tells the definition and tells more about the shared memory and the memory passing in the comunication. Also there are some example that using IPC systems.
## 9. Deadlock
  * a. [Introducing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)
  * This page give me more information to understand about deadlock which occurswhen a thread enters a waiting state becauase is held by another waiting process. It also give us some prevent deadlock situation and some exercises.
## 10. Starvation
  * a. [Definiton](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/#:~:text=Starvation%20is%20the%20problem%20that,from%20ever%20getting%20the%20CPU.)
  * The information to understand when the starvation is occurs and it also provide some explanation the difference between Deadlock and Starvation.
  * b. [Definiton II](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-starvation-problem-in-an-operating-system)
  * This page is another page if the first page is quite to understand. This page also tells some resource in our execution isn't assign and some measure to handle the starvation.
## 11. CPU Schedulling
 * a. [CPU Burst](https://www.fandimedia.com/2018/09/apa-maksud-core-dan-threads-pada.html)
 * This webpage contains the more explaination about scheduling especially in CPU. Also the definition about CPU burst.
 * b. [Linux](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/11.0/chapter05/chapter05.html)
 * This page is for the material for this week which actually can learn more by reading many topics for Linux Operating System. For this week, the assignment is from chapter 1 until chapter 5.
